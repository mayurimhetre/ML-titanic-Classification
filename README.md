## Titanic - Machine Learning Classification

### About the Dataset
The **Titanic dataset** is one of the most popular beginner datasets in machine learning. It contains data about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including features like:

- Age
- Sex
- Passenger class (Pclass)
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked location
- Whether they survived (`Survived`: 1 = Yes, 0 = No)

The dataset is provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and is often used to practice binary classification.
